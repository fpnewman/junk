<strong>Background:</strong><br />


The abuse of prescription and non-prescription opioids is one of the greatest public health threats in the US today. Ninety-one Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. Driven by this alarming rate of opioid abuse and misuse, drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S. Nearly 2.5 million people in the US are suffering from opioid addiction related to prescription drugs for chronic pain. Opioid use disorders (OUD&rsquo;s) were most common among those who were uninsured or unemployed, were low-income individuals, or had behavioral health problems. Seventy-five to eighty-three percent of those reported starting with a prescription drug. Presently, death rates from opioid overdoses in rural areas exceeds urban areas, contributing to 63% of all overdose deaths. Those states with the highest opioid prescriptions per capita also have the highest opioid overdose mortality. These staggering rates are overwhelming families, communities, first responders, and healthcare facilities nationwide, with consequences that could reverberate for generations. The complexity of the crisis necessitates a multidimensional and multi-sectoral research effort.<br />
A major consequence of OUD is opioid-associated Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and the considerable pressure on the foster care system generated by NAS.&nbsp; Although the immediate consequences of this crisis are well known, knowledge gaps exist on <a name="_Hlk497210763">the long-term consequences of NAS on growth and development, behavioral outcomes, as well as the effect of involvement of dysfunctional parents in the care of opioid-dependent newborns</a> or the alternative of foster care. OUD also increases risk of infectious diseases with co-use of illicit substances by injection especially hepatitis viruses and HIV.<br />
The majority (80%) of persons with OUD had another substance use disorder (SUD). Among persons with OUD, 29% had major depressive episode(MDE), 32% had bipolar disorder, 13% had schizophrenia, 53% smoked cigarettes, 41% had alcohol use disorder (AUD), and 43% had &ge;1 other drug use disorder.<br />
Rates of opioid overdose deaths continued to increase for all racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic Whites (hence, Whites) and American Indian/ Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) have experienced&nbsp;the largest rise in opioid-related fatalities. The American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, historically vulnerable to substance use, have an overdose rate comparable to Whites. Overdose rates increased 63% for Black persons and 43% for Latinos from 1999 to 2015. By comparison, the rate of overdose deaths among White persons increased 240% from 1999 to 2015 and similar increases were noted for AI/AN populations. By 2014, Whites and AI/AN&rsquo;s were dying at double or triple the rates of African Americans and Latinos, respectively. Factors that may contribute to these disparities include preferential opioid prescribing to Whites in specific clinical settings, and possible differences in clinical pharmacogenomics. There may also be undefined social and cultural factors among Latinos and African Americans that contribute to these observed differences. In summary, multiple factors specific to these populations may contribute to racial differences in opioid sensitivity, clinical management and resistance to opioid misuse. Available data indicate that a disproportionate burden of opioid use overdose deaths is borne by persons living in rural areas of less privileged socioeconomic status. There are no data on patterns of opioid use among sexual gender minorities and limited data on Asians, Native Hawaiians and US Pacific Islanders.<br />
Women of reproductive age (15&ndash;44 years) receive more prescription medications than men, which in turn resulted in increased risk of misuse. Presently, a woman reports to the emergency department every three minutes requesting pain medication. The face of the opioid epidemic is increasingly young, White, and female. Among diagnosed OUD in 2015, 0.9 million were men and 1.2 million women, with 3,300 women affected daily. Women who misuse opioids face gender-specific challenges that affects access to treatment, effectiveness of treatment and outcomes. Unlike men, women commonly report stigma as one of the top reasons they do not seek treatment for substance use disorders. Women seeking treatment report high rates of childhood victimization, histories of sexual abuse, and current danger (47%) from violent partner. In contrast to men, women also tend to enter treatment at a much later stage of addiction, with more serious health complications due to accelerated physiological damage. More research is needed to address the gender-specific challenges posed by the opioid misuse crisis.<br />
